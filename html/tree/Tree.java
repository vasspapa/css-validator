/**
 * Defines the general interface for Tree manipulation.
 *
 * The design problem here, is that we need to manipulate Nodes and Leaves the
 * same way: For example, for a given Node, A factory may choose to return a
 * Node or a Leaf. so its create() method should return a Leaf and this would
 * force us to dynamically cast the Leaf into Node when needed.
 *
 * For both code clarity and performance I think its better to imagine we are
 * manipulating only Nodes and let the node itself decide if it is a leaf or
 * not. Leaves, should throw an IllegalTreeOperation for methods that have no
 * semantic.
