HTML parser for JDK 1.0 release.
http://aldan.paragraph.com/JavaApp/htmlpars.tar.Z

I modified the code of HTML parser prototype, developed for testing the beta release of HotJava
by Arthur van Hoff <http://java.sun.com/people/avh/>.
Some time ago the original code could be found at ftp://java.sun.com/pub/java/avh/html.tar.z 

I tried to get in touch with the author of the code with no result :(

 Anyway, I have a working version of HTML parser for JDK 1.0 release now,
 which doesn't require alpha3 version of HotJava to be installed.
 
 It has the  following limitations :
  - no user properties support ;
  - doesn't provide HotJava functionality, such as
  net.www.http.HttpClient.firewallProxyHost;


cheers,
Dima.

the his sources :

>Hi,
>
>In this directory you will find a prototype of the HTML parser
>that we are testing for the beta release of HotJava. This code
>is being released to generate some early feedback. It is covered
>by the same licencing agreement as the alpha3 release of HotJava.
>
>The code in html.Parser reads a DTD and parses an html file. HTML
>errors are reported. For example:
>
>	java html.Parser http://java.sun.com/
>
>You can also parse just the DTD as follows:
>
>	java html.DTD html2-net
>
>This will print a complete listing of the DTD.
>

>
>NOTE: It requires that you have installed the alpha3 version of
>HotJava on your machine.
>
>NOTE: This is a prototype. It is by no means complete or bug
>free. Please use it, fix it and let me know what the problems are
>so that I can make sure they get fixed in the beta release.
>
>NOTE: The code reads a properties file from your ~/.hotjava
>directory as well as from the current directory. This means that
>you should run it in the current directory.
